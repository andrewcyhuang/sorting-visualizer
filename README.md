<h1 align="center">Sorting visualizer</h1>

## Motivation

I created this project to solidify my understanding of the different sorting algorithms by implementing them with animations to visualize the sorting process.

## Install and Run

To use my sorting visualizer, clone the repo and run these commands in the root directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```
